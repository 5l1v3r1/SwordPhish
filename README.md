# SwordPhish
**At some point technology will fail and your users will be the last line of defence. SwordPhish allows users to easily report suspicious e-mails to your IT and security teams.**

SwordPhish is a very simple but effective button that sits within the users Outlook toolbar. One click and the suspicious e-mail is instantly reported and contains all metadata required for investigation.

**SwordPhish should be underpinned by your security awareness programme**. Suspicious e-mails can't be reported if your users don't know what they are looking for or what to deem suspicious.

The recipient of reports receives the original reported e-mail as an  attachment along with every header to aid further investigation.

# Requirements
SwordPhish requires Microsoft Office 2007+, .NET Framework 4.0+ and [VTSO 4.0+](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48217) to be installed, and works across both X86 and X64 platforms.

# Installation
The easiest way to install SwordPhish is via the pre-compiled MSI installers under the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Schillings/SwordPhish/releases) - make sure you run as an administrator.

If you are so inclined you can build SwordPhish from source. Simply clone this repository and compile with Visual Studio 2010+.

# Deployment
You can deploy SwordPhish as you would any other application: manually, Group Policy, batch file at logon, or your favourite systems management solution.

# Options
SwordPhish just needs to know where to send reports to. You can set other options via the MSI installer or property flags:

Flag | Description
---- | -----------
RECIPIENTPROPERTY | E-mail address where to send SwordPhish reports
SUBJECTPROPERTY | Subject of SwordPhish reports
ACTIONPROPERTY | What to do after a user reports an e-mail. 0 = Just send the report, 1 = Report and move the e-mail to "Junk", 2 = Report and delete the e-mail from the user's Inbox.

For example: `msiexec /i Schillings.SwordPhish.Installer.msi RECIPIENTPROPERTY="reports@mysoc.com" ACTIONPROPERTY=2`

To make your life easier for reporting it is recommended to set the recipient address to a ticketing system.
